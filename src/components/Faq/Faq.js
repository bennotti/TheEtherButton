                    <p>Hereâ€™s what you need to play:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A computer with Chrome or Firefox</li>

                    <p><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Button_(Reddit)">The Button was an online meta-game and social experiment that featured an online button and 60 second countdown timer that would reset each time the button was pressed</a>.

                <FaqItem title="What can I do with my button click flairs?">
                    <p>All click flairs have been designed as <a target="_blank" href="http://erc721.org/">ERC-721</a> tokens, so you can trade them as you please. Despite this, please note that you still are only allowed to click the button a single time. </p>
