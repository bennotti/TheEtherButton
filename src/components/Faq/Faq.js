                <FaqItem title="Why this game?">
                    <p><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Button_(Reddit)">The Button was an online meta-game and social experiment that featured an online button and 60 second countdown timer that would reset each time the button was pressed</a>. We thought it would be fun to re-create the same concept but on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>

                <FaqItem title="How can I play?">

                <FaqItem title="What are the rules?">
                    <p>All game rules have been codified in an Ethereum <a target="_blank" href="https://www.coindesk.com/information/ethereum-smart-contracts-work/">Smart Contract</a>:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Each time the button is clicked, it will reset the counter to 20 blocks.</li>
                        <li>You will be awarded a unique <a target="_blank" href="http://erc721.org/">ERC-721</a> token, based on how close the counter is to Block 0 when you click it.</li>
                        <li>You may only click the button once per game round (ie generation).</li>
                        <li>The game ends once someone clicks the button at block 0. This increments the game "generation" and restarts the game. All players keep will retain ownership of all tokens at the end of a round.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This game is intended to act as a type of social experiment, where anyone can reset the progress made by all other players.</p>
                </FaqItem>
                <FaqItem title="What can I do with my button click flairs?">
                    <p>All click flairs have been designed as <a target="_blank" href="http://erc721.org/">ERC-721</a> tokens, which means that each will exist as a unique token that you own. In accordance with this standard, you're free to sell, collect, trade, or do anything else with your tokens. Please note that you still are only allowed to click the button a single time per game.</p>
                </FaqItem>
                <FaqItem title="What does it cost?">
                    <p>Clicking the button costs a small amount (ie 0.001ETH) in order to discourage someone from creating 1000s of Ethereum accounts and constantly spamming this Smart Contract.</p>
                </FaqItem>
                <FaqItem title="Where's the code?" >
                    <p>All code is freely available on GitHub: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/wbaumann/TheEtherButton">TheEtherButton</a>.</p>
                </FaqItem>
                <FaqItem title="Isn't this contract vulernable to front running?" >
                    <p>Sure is... Blockchains are subject to race conditions, meaning that the order of transactions in a given block can be manipulated. We have not attempted to handle this scenario to allow for further manipulation of the gameplay.</p>
